# Surabaya Kita

## Introduction

This project is a full-stack site, Surabaya Kita, that allows a database of registered users
 to manage a common dataset, which comprises a variety of community events. 
 It can be accessed here http://surabaya-kita.herokuapp.com/

The site is based around an independent cafe, set up by a foreigner who moved to a new city in Indonesia and 
wanted to meet new people and find some fun acitvities to do within their community. The site also provides some brief information 
about the caf√© and its story, including a map and contact functions. Users are able to view and search all the events avaialble and also 
 create, edit and delete their own events, while the site owner maintains admin control over the
 database. By basing the events site around the cafe, the site owner 
can add value to their community and increase their customer base and sales by hosting user events within the cafe. 


## UX

### Design Choices

**Overall Design**
The site has a clear identity, with a consistent and predictable theme and style throughout. 
The site layout is simple with a navbar at the top right, which collapses to a hamburger menu 
on smaller screen sizes, the site name as a home page link and
 and a standard footer with contact information and links to social media pages (not active). 
 All clickable links have clear actions and responses. The site is designed over 
multiple pages and each page's content is clear. It is easy to know where you are, 
or how to get where you want to be. There are additional buttons 
 on pages such as My Events, My Profile to direct the user. 

The elements and features are clear and legible. 
The key elements are easy to recognise and disclosed progressively over different pages. The features currently offered provide the user 
and owner with what they need, and they are simple 
to implement and use. Future releases can add value in bite-size increments, such as displaying events in caledar 
or map format, using profile information to tailor suggested events to users (e.g. Events Near You / Events You May Like), 
and allowing users to express interest in a particular event. 

**Font**
The google font, Khumb Sans, was chosen for the site, as it is clear, simple, easy to read
 and doesn't detract from any content.

**Colours**
The colour scheme for the site is based on three main colours, bright cyan, light green and white. 
These colours represent Surabaya to the site owner / developer - the cyan of the sky and the sea (it's a coastal city) and the green of 
the fields and jungle surround the city (it's tropical) - and give a fresh, vibrant but grown up look, which reflects 
the ethos of the cafe and the site owner and represents the target broad age range adult user. The typography is a medium-dark grey 
or cyan for links, and for headers and flashed messages it is white on cyan or light green banners respectively. 

The colour scheme is also carried through the site, including create, edit, cancel and delete buttons, 
within the forms and e.g. dropdown menus and time and date pickers. 

**Card images**
The images used on the site were chosen as they visually represent the categories of the events.
They are all bright, vibrant images, making the events more attractive to the users. Where the images
are they developer's own, they have a similar colour palette to the theme of the site. 

**Styling** 
 The events are 
 displayed as individual cards with the event name (user-generated), category name and photo (admin-generated) 
 for easy visual filtering, and a short description of the event. There is a "reveal" function, 
 evident by the plus icon, that on click displays the detailed event information, such as date, time,
 location, etc. By hiding this information it keeps the site cleaner. 
 On loading the Home page, only the events organized by Surabaya Kita are displayed 
 with a button to the Events page. On the Events page only the events happening in the current month are displayed initially, with an 
 expandable div for All Events, to keep the pages cleaner.
 
 The forms for creating and editing events, signing up and editing the user profile are clear and simple with 
 a defensive design shown by warning signs and a red underline that turns green when validated. 
 All buttons have text and icons to make their actions clear. Forms also use card styling. 
 
**Icons**
 Icons are used to reduce text, in the events cards, and all the forms.
They have been chosen for their obvious meaning, but some have been tooltipped for the user's assistance. 

### Wireframes

A series of wireframes have been generated for desktop, tablet and mobile views. The idea of the site was 
smaller when the wireframes were first created, however, the general colour scheme (but not the specific colours),
 and the overall layout (e.g. using cards for the events and categories, the footer) has remained the same. 
 Wireframes can be found here https://github.com/junokili/Surabaya-Kita/tree/master/static/images/mock_ups


## Features

Features include:
- **About Us** - information about the Surabaya Kita Cafe, including a brief, personal story, 
map and a carousel of photos 
- **Monthly Events** - highlighting what's on in or around the cafe organized by the business owners. 
As these are events organized by the site, users can feel confident and safe in joining them.
- **Events: Events this Month** - a card display of events within the current month. The cards give a visual representation of the 
event so users can quickly scan for those of interest
- **Events: All Events** - a collapsible card display of all of the available events to reduce clutter on the screen
- **Search Bar** - so users can search by category or keyword
- **Sign Up / Login / Log Out** - a signing up feature as only registered members can create events. 
New users are automatically logged in and redirected to the My Profile page. Users can easily log out at the
end of a session
- **My Profile** - basic information about the user. This allows events to be attached to a username
so other users can search events based on a username. Additional future features.
- **My Events** - a apage where users can view, edit or delete their own events
- **Create Event / Edit Event** - simple forms for users to create and edit their own new events
- **Contact Us Form** - a simple form so users can easily ask queries to the site owners or ask for additional 
categories / locations to be added to the database. 
- **Manage Categories** - a simple page for the site owner to read, create, edit and delete categories. 

Future features:
- **Calendar of Events** - a graphical way of showing the upcoming events 
- **Map of Events** - use event location to display events on a map
- **Advanced Search** - combining queries e.g. category and location
- **Automatic Delete of Expired Events** - to reduce admin time and not frustrate users by having out of date events
-**Register Interest in an Event** - action buttons associated to events to allows users to register interest, 
so the event host has an idea of numbers
- **My Profile** - by increasing the functionality of the profile information 
users will be able to automatically see events near them (using the location they chose when signing up)
 and add their interests to get more focused events that may be relevant. User profile photos can be uploaded, 
 to replace the current placeholder. 
 - **Cafe info** - additional information about the cafe, eg address, opening hours, menus etc
 - **Manage locations** - similar to the Manage Categories features, there will be a manage locations feature
 where the admin can view, create, edit and delete locations. 
 - **Additional confirmation for Workshops** - this will initially be monitored by admin for use of the workshop area and users contacted by email.
Admin would need to be able to confirm the use of the workshop space
 and arrange a deal with food and drink discounts for users. 

## Technologies used

- HTML: layout and content 
- CSS: styling
- JavaScript: google maps API, contact us/email and delete confirmation 
- Python and Flask: connecting to MongoDB and performing CRUD operations
- MongoDB: for the database with events, locations, users, and categories https://mongodb.com
- Font Awesome: icons that visually represent the form criteria and info display https://fontawesome.com
- Google Fonts: a back-up font family that represents the style and design of the site https://fonts.google.com
- Materialize (CSS, JavaScript/JQuery) for the functionality of the navbar, hamburger menu, photo carousel, 
forms, basic card and card reveal styling, dropdown menus, date and time pickers
    and the grid structuring of the site https://materialize.com


## Testing 

- **Links**

All internal and external links have been tested. 
The links to external sites (e.g. facebook, instagram) display a "coming soon" image as the social media for the site
has not yet been created. 
Internal links, such as button clicks, menu links, links to sections, 
have all been verified that they perform as requested. 

- **Contact us form**

On submission the form comes up with an error if it hasn't been filled in correctly (e.g. email address), 
or if required information (name, email address and details in the text box) is missing. 
The form data is sent as an email to the site owner. The email received contains all the submitted data 
(name, email and the message). Email receipt has been verified in the associated account. 
A success message is shown only when the form is successfully submitted. 

- **Responsiveness**

At every stage of the development process the responsiveness of the site has been checked through chrome 
developer tools for all available device formats.
The grid structuring uses responsive parameters for display effectiveness in e.g. displaying parallel event cards 
(4 on large screens, 3 on medium screens and 1 on small screens) and also for the navbar collapsing below medium 
 screen widths. There are also font size changes for display effectiveness in e.g. the headers and the search boxes. 
The site has also been tested successfully on different browsers e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge.  

- **Language Validation**

The HTML was validated through W3C HTML Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/nu/). 
A significant number of errors appear, however these are due to the curly brackets used with the python/flask app. 
One warning is noted, which is due to a repeated id value in the Edit Event form, however, this results from a switch in a meterilize form
repeated in an if / else function.

The CSS was validated with no reported errors through W3C CSS Validation Service (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

The JavaScript files were validated through JSHint (https://jshint.com/) with the only errors being 
the use of functionality only with ES6 (for which a comment was added) 
and apparent unused functions, however these are all invoked within other functions 
or button clicks, likewise the apparent undefined variables are all defined and utilised.

The Python code was validated with no reported errors through PEP8 Online (http://pep8online.com/).
